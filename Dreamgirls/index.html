        <h3>Movie vs. Broadway: what changes?</h3>
        <p>
          <em>Dreamgirls</em> plays differently on screen and on stage, even while telling the same story of ambition, artistry, and friendship.
          The movie uses editing, close-ups, and location scale to expand the world around the singers and their entourage.
          Cinematography frames details—the shake of a hand, the flicker of a spotlight—to dial up intimacy and tension.
          Broadway, by contrast, trades the camera for the electricity of a live room where audience energy loops back to the performers.
          Practical effects, quick changes, and light cues create music-video-like transitions in real time.
          Both versions keep the heart of the tale: who gets to be heard, who gets center stage, and what success truly costs.
          That shared core lets fans compare mediums without losing the show’s soul.

        <p>
          Orchestrations shift subtly between mediums: film mixes deliver radio-polished sheen while live pits breathe with tempo and phrasing.
          Dialogue pacing tightens on screen, but stage scenes often linger so audience reactions become part of the rhythm.
          Costumes shimmer in both versions, though the stage leans into silhouette and reflectivity to read from the back row.
          Character arcs stay aligned, yet performance choices add color—every cast brings new timing, tone, and chemistry.
          The score anchors turning points in either format, with “And I Am Telling You” still detonating emotion in the room.
          Whether you watch the camera swoop or the curtain rise, the story lands because the music carries it there.
