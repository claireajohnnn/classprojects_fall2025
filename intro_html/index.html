    <h2>The Historical Hamilton</h2>
    <p>
      Alexander Hamilton (c. 1755/1757–1804) was one of the most influential Founding Fathers of the United States.
      Born in the Caribbean and rising from poverty, Hamilton became George Washington’s aide-de-camp during the Revolutionary War and
      earned a reputation as a brilliant military and political strategist. After the war, he became the nation’s first Secretary of the Treasury,
      where he established the financial systems that stabilized the young republic. He proposed a national bank, created a system of public credit,
      and developed policies that encouraged industry and commerce. Although his life was cut short in a duel with Aaron Burr,
      Hamilton’s vision and work continue to shape American government and economics.

    <h3>The Broadway Phenomenon</h3>
    <p>
      <em>Hamilton: An American Musical</em>, created by Lin-Manuel Miranda, brought Hamilton’s story to the world in a revolutionary way.
      Blending hip-hop, R&amp;B, and traditional show tunes, the musical tells Hamilton’s journey from immigrant outsider to one of America’s most important leaders.
      Since its debut in 2015, the show has won 11 Tony Awards, a Pulitzer Prize for Drama, and international acclaim.
      Its diverse cast reimagines the Founding Fathers, challenging audiences to connect history with America’s present identity.
      More than just a performance, the musical has sparked renewed interest in Hamilton’s writings, speeches, and lasting legacy.

    <!-- Final Paragraph -->
    <p>
      The historical Hamilton and the Broadway musical together reveal two powerful ways of remembering the past.
      One focuses on facts, policies, and the creation of institutions, while the other brings his personality and ambition to life through music and storytelling.
      Both perspectives show Hamilton as a man driven by vision, resilience, and a desire to leave a lasting mark on his country.
      His contributions to finance, government, and law remain vital to the United States, while the musical ensures his story continues to inspire younger generations.
      Through both history and art, Hamilton’s legacy lives on, bridging the gap between the 18th century and today.
