    <h3>What the stage does best</h3>
    <p>
      The Broadway production of <em>Wicked</em> thrives on live energy. Special effects like Elphaba’s famous lift during
      “Defying Gravity” happen right before the audience’s eyes, creating a sense of wonder that film cannot replicate.
      Lighting, props, and costumes transform the stage into Emerald City with every scene change. The audience becomes part
      of the experience, reacting together and feeding the actors’ performances. Each show is unique depending on the cast
      and the crowd, making live theater unforgettable. The Broadway version is more intimate, using stagecraft and
      performance energy to create magic without relying on visual effects.
    </p>

    <h3>Signature songs & storytelling</h3>
    <p>
      The Broadway production gave life to the now-iconic score. “The Wizard and I” introduces Elphaba’s ambitions,
      “Popular” showcases Glinda’s comedic charm, and “For Good” brings the story full circle with a heartfelt goodbye.
      “Defying Gravity” remains a centerpiece, combining vocals, staging, and lights for maximum impact. The live orchestra
      adds depth and power to each number, while the performers’ voices vary slightly each night, making every show unique.
      The songs not only entertain but also drive the story forward, ensuring that music and narrative are inseparable on
      the Broadway stage.
